# Lab Week 2

Due Feb 10 by 11:59pm | Points 10 | Submitting a file upload | Available until Feb 12 at 11:59pm 

This lab will be dedicated to finishing the Maze Solver recursive program discussed in the Lecture 2 slides.

Objective:
In this lab, you will implement a recursive algorithm to solve a maze. The maze is represented as a 2D array where 1 represents walls and 0 represents valid paths. The goal is to find a path from the starting point to the exit, if one exists, using recursion.

Rubric:

- Recursive Logic (45%) - Proper selection of base and recursive cases. 
- Testing and Debugging (10%) - Thorough testing with a variety of test cases, code doesn't crash with unexpected input.
- Commenting and Structure (10%) - Code is well-organized, with meaningful variable names, professional comments, and clear logic flow. 
- Demo and Oral Questions (35%) - Once your code is complete, you will demo the working code to me during lab time, and you will be asked questions to ensure you understand how your code functions.
