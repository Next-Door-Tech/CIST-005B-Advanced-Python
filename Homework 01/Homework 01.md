# Homework Assignment: Introduction to GitHub

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to create a GitHub account and familiarize yourself with basic GitHub concepts and operations. This will prepare you for future collaborative coding projects and introduce you to industry-standard version control practices.

## Tasks

1. Create a GitHub Account (If you don't already have one)

    Go to GitHub Links to an external site.
    Click on "Sign up" and follow the prompts to create your account
    Choose a username that you're comfortable sharing with classmates and future employers

2. Set Up Your Profile

    Add a profile picture (or an avatar)
    Fill out your bio with a brief description of your coding interests or goals
    (Optional) Add your location and any relevant links (e.g., personal website, LinkedIn)

3. Create Your First Repository

    Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
    Name it "python-learning-journal"
    Add a brief description: "A repository to document my Python learning journey"
    Initialize with a README file
    Choose a license (recommend MIT License for beginners)
    Create the repository

4. Edit the README File

    Open the README.md file in your new repository
    Click the pencil icon to edit
    Add the following sections:
        About Me
        Goals for This Course
        My First Python Program (include a simple "Hello, World!" program in a code block)
    Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message

5. Create a New File

    In your repository, click "Add file" then "Create new file"
    Name it "week1_reflections.md"
    Add some content reflecting on what you've learned about Python so far
    Commit the new file

6. Use GitHub Issues

    Go to the "Issues" tab in your repository
    Create a new issue titled "Topics I Want to Learn"
    In the body, list at least 3 Python topics you're excited to learn about
    Add the label "enhancement" to your issue

7. Explore GitHub

    Use the search function to find at least 3 interesting Python projects
    Star these repositories
    Follow at least 2 Python developers or organizations

## Submission

    Submit the URL of your GitHub profile
    Submit the URL of your "python-learning-journal" repository

## Grading Criteria

    Completion of all tasks: 80%
    Quality and thoughtfulness of README and reflection content: 15%
    Proper use of Markdown formatting: 5%

## Resources

    GitHub Guides Links to an external site.
    GitHub Hello World Links to an external site.
    Markdown Cheatsheet Links to an external site.

Remember, GitHub is a powerful tool used by developers worldwide. Don't worry if it seems complicated at first - we'll be using it throughout the course, and you'll become more comfortable with it over time.

Good luck, and happy coding!
